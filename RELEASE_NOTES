          Add minimum ticks (1) for width calculation, asked by Leonid

R1.1.0    March 21, 2018   Till Straumann

          Set DOL=1 for trigger polarity so that they come up with
          the usual 'rising-edge'. Otherwise, normal triggers are
          asserted until initialized.
         

R1.0.0    March 21, 2018   Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)

          Use cpsw frame R3.6.3
          Use hpsTpr R1.0.0
          Use yamlLoader R1.1.0
           

          Merge with Till's ts_fixes branch 

          Merge branch 'ts_fixes'
          new-style EPICS_BASE definition in RELEASE_SITE
          Removed RELEASE_SITE from git
          configure/RELEASE: removed unused TIMINGAPI definition
          Makefile: removed std=c++0x; replaced -I$(VAR) by $(addprefix -I,$(VAR))
          configure/RELEASE: removed unused TIMINGAPI definition
          Makefile: removed std=c++0x; replaced -I$(VAR) by $(addprefix -I,$(VAR))
          ... this expands to an empty string if VAR is empty (the original version to '-I'
          which can be harmful)
