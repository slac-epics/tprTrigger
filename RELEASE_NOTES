             remarks)  ch12 and ch13 has been designed for tprTrigger internal usage (no hardware trigger)
                       butt we have an issue to use the ch12 and ch13 for the internal usage
                       until resolving the issue, we borrow ch 11 and ch 12 for the internal usage.

             - ch11 and ch12 have been reserved for 360Hz processing and other TBD usage, for temporally
               thus, database template could not access ch11 and ch12 and trg11 and ch12
             - after resolving the issue, we will move to ch12 and ch13 for the internal usage,
               and will expose ch11 and ch12 to the database template
